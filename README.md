# Udacity DevOps Nanodegree Project2
---

Basic usage
---

This project uses a cloudformation script to launch autoscaling EC2 instances.
Running the script will create two stacks named IAC-Network and IAC-Servers, starting with the network stack.

To get started run: `./create-stack-IAC`

To delete stacks first run: `./delete IAC-Servers`. Once complete you can delete the network stack with `./delete IAC-Network`.
